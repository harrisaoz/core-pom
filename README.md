# core-pom
Basic dependencies for producing Java-based command line tools.

Unless requested to do so, I will not publish this to Maven Central, as it is unlikely to be generally useful
beyond the first few months of 2019.  It may acquire a non-SNAPSHOT version at some point.

In order to make use of this project, clone it locally (forked or not), then run

  mvn install

to install the pom in your local maven cache.
